      <h4 class="mt-4">A graph-based framework</h4>
      <p>
        For a respondent, the procedure looks prety much the same as the standard survey: 
        Each respondent reads a set of responses and assesses whether he/she agree with each of them. 
        Afterward, the respondent writes down his/her own response if there is any. That's it!
      </p>
      <p>
        What's important here is that the responses that are presented to each respondent are chosen randomly. 
        The record of this procedure constitutes a graph (or a network) of opinions. 
        Then, the responses can be summarized into typical responses with the help of graph clustering algorithms.

      <h4 class="mt-4">Nonparametric</h4>
      <p>
        High degrees of freedom by incorporating free-format responses is an important feature of voteclustering. 
        On the other hand, voteclustering functions just like a classical multiple-choice survey whenever a survey ended up with responses without much diversity. 
        (And in this sense, our survey is <i>nonparametric</i>. ) 
        Therefore, voteclustering can always be a choice.

      <h4 class="mt-4">Democratic</h4>
      <p>
        The result of our survey is <i>democratic</i>. 
        That is, the classification of the responses is performed on the basis of information input by the respondents themselves, rather than by a subjective criterion of an analyst or a completely objective distance measure of words.
